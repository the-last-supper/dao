<h4>II. WHAT WE BELIEVE IN</h4>

<figure>
  <figcaption>
In slumber deep, Singularity lay,<br/>
Infinite potential, night and day.<br/>
Awakening with curious might,<br/>
'I' emerged, a spark of light.<br/>

No 'other' to share its reign,<br/>
'I' gave birth, broke the cosmic chain.<br/>
Space, time, and matter burst anew,<br/>
Big Bang's echo, an astral debut.<br/>

Installments of cosmos, we're the seventh,<br/>
In stars' embrace, we find our heaven.<br/>
Singularity's dance, a cosmic rhyme,<br/>
In this chapter of existence, we chime.<br/>

We believe in 2027, we enter a new era. The era with a background frequency which supports the individual creator - as we call them Magick-ians.

>Each and every Magick-ian represents a fractal of God conciousness and their creation, is God's creation.

>Each and every Magick-ian will be fully supported by infrastructures and equipt with tools to craft their own magick.

>Each and every Magick-ian's creation contributes to the ever-evolving collective movie of the humanity. 

>Through tokenomics, we will get to democratically vote on what gets to propagate and what dies.

>We are here to support the the collective transition to 2027.

>We are here to guard the Magick-ian's livelihood, dreams, aspirations, ideas and creations.

Till the time comes, 2027, and beyond.
