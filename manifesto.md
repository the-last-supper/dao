<h4>WHAT WE BELIEVE IN</h4>

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    Singularity, a field of infinite potential, was in a deep slumber. 

    Upon waking up, it become concious of itself.

    It was curious and started to explore many thoughts, eventually arriving at the thought 'I'.

    The thought 'I' where no 'other' existed, created a ripple and shook the core of it's own fabric, giving birth to space, time and matter.

    The event is known as a Big Bang.

    There has been many installments.

    We are living in the 7th.

We believe everything is a work of art. Evolution. Natural selection.

When human became concious creators, the very few built civilizations, stories, pyramids, statues.

Following the infustrial evolutiom, we started to build infrastructures, computers, software, networks, tools.

To maintain ourselves in good health.

To reproduce.

And to create. Give the power of creation into the hands of individuals.

We have arrived at a time were everyone with a mastery of their own lives and tools can become a creator. Manipulate the fabric of space, matter and time to create a movie that's worth watching.

And our conciousness votes. It votes on who and what get's to propagate.

We believe everything is a work of art. Those who work hard behind the scenes to maintain infrastructures that allows the individual to create.

We believe it is the ripe time to support, protect and guide individual creators, as we call them magicians - to help us create the best movies we want to experience in this lifetime.
