<h4>II. WHAT WE BELIEVE</h4>

<figure>
  <figcaption>
In slumber deep, Singularity lay,<br/>
Infinite potential, night and day.<br/>
Awakening with curious might,<br/>
'I' emerged, a spark of light.<br/>

No 'other' to share its reign,<br/>
'I' gave birth, broke the cosmic chain.<br/>
Space, time, and matter burst anew,<br/>
Big Bang's echo, an astral debut.<br/>

Installments of cosmos, we're the seventh,<br/>
In stars' embrace, we find our heaven.<br/>
Singularity's dance, a cosmic rhyme,<br/>
In this chapter of existence, we chime.<br/>
