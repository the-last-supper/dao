<h4>WHAT WE BELIEVE IN</h4>

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    Singularity, a field of infinite potential, was in deep slumber. 

    Upon waking up, it become concious of itself.

    It was curious and started to explore many thoughts, eventually arriving at the thought 'I'.

    The thought 'I' where no 'other' existed, created a ripple and shook the core of it's own fabric, giving birth to space, time and matter.

    The event is known as a Big Bang.

    There has been many installments.

    We are living in one.
