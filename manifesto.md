    "The Last Supper" is a renowned mural painting created by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci. Completed between 1495 and 1498, the painting is considered one of the most iconic and significant works of art in Western history. It depicts the final meal that Jesus Christ shared with his disciples before his crucifixion, a moment that holds great religious and cultural significance.

The Last Supper is a new network, an autonomous organization made of Magickians for Magickians.


We are <u>anomymous</u>

The organization is runned anonymously, though our identity is an amalgamation of the identifies of all the magickians and members involved.


We are <u>for profit</u>

<center>II. OUR PURPOSE</center>

We [FUND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens) magickians:

>Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011) was an Anglo-American author, columnist, essayist, orator, religious and literary critic, social critic, and journalist. Hitchens was the author, co-author, editor or co-editor of over 30 books, including five collections of essays on culture, politics and literature. A staple of public discourse, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded intellectual and a controversial public figure. He contributed to New Statesman, The Nation, The Weekly Standard, The Atlantic, London Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement, Slate, Free Inquiry and Vanity Fair.
